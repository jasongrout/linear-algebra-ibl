\chapter{Vector Spaces}
\section{Outline}
Again, for $\RR^n$, $P_n$, $\RR^{m\times n}$, and formal power
series. Start emphasizing coordinate vectors more.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the span of these vectors?  Emphasize a vector space is
  a span of vectors.

\item Is something in the span?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item solving systems of equations
  \item Matrix-vector multiplication as a shorthand way of writing
    linear combinations in $\RR^n$.
  \item Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition
  \item A solution is a linear combination of a vector in the null
    space and a particular solution
  \item polynomial interpolation/Least Squares?
  \end{enumerate}

\item Is this set a span?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item sets of solutions
  \item eigenvectors
  \item functions that vanish at a certain point
  \end{enumerate}

\item linear independence/dependence

\item basis, coordinate vectors
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Uniqueness of coordinate vectors
  \item bases have same size
  \item building bases from linearly independent sets or spanning sets
  \item When you have orthonormal bases, finding coordinates becomes
    much easier
  \item Making a basis orthonormal
  \end{enumerate}

\item changing definition of addition or multiplication (semi-log
  space example)
\item Changing definition of inner product

\end{enumerate}
