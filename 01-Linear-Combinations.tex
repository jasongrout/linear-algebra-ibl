\chapter{Linear Combinations}
Do each of these in $\RR^n$, $P_n$, $\RR^{m\times n}$, and formal power
  series rings.  Maybe also for $4\times 4$ pixel images (represented
  as matrices)?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define linear combination.  See geometry in $\RR^n$
\item Matrix-vector multiplication as a shorthand way of writing
  linear combinations in $\RR^n$.
\item Determinant---area/volume (but maybe not needed?  Maybe this
  should be introduced later as a multilinear map?)
\item Calculate inner product, length, angle, orthogonality, and
  projection in each space (except formal power series).  Examine
  these geometrically in $\RR^n$.  This introduces trace and transpose
  for the matrix space.
\end{enumerate}
