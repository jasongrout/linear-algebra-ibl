\chapter{Linear Transformations}

We want mappings that preserve linear combinations.

\begin{itemize}
\item Define linear transformation
\item Is this a linear transformation?
\item Pick bases, representation with matrices
\item kernel, image (nullspace, columnspace), (one-to-one; onto),
  rank, nullity
\item The preimage of a vector is a linear combination of a vector in
  the null space and a particular solution.  Relate this to the
  general/specific breakdown of a solution to a system of equations.
\item inverse transformations/matrices
\item change of basis matrix
\item eigenvalues/eigenvectors---nice bases for linear transformations
\item composition of transformations/multiplication of matrices
\item Symmetric matrices and spectral theorem
\end{itemize}
