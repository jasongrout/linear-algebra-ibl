\chapter{Linear Transformations}

This unit covers the following ideas. In preparation for the quiz and
exam, make sure you have a lesson plan containing examples that
explain and illustrate the following concepts.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Objective 1
\item Objective 2
\end{enumerate}
You'll have a chance to teach your examples to your peers prior to the exam.

We want mappings that preserve linear combinations.

\begin{itemize}
\item Define linear transformation
\item Is this a linear transformation?
\item Pick bases, representation with matrices
\item kernel, image (nullspace, columnspace), (one-to-one; onto),
  rank, nullity
\item inverse transformations/matrices
\item change of basis matrix
\item eigenvalues/eigenvectors---nice bases for linear transformations
\item composition of transformations/multiplication of matrices
\item Symmetric matrices and spectral theorem
\end{itemize}
